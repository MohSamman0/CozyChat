# CozyChat Architecture

CozyChat is a modern, secure, and scalable anonymous chat platform built with cutting-edge technologies and best practices.

## System Overview

CozyChat is designed as a real-time anonymous chat application that connects strangers for meaningful conversations. The architecture emphasizes security, performance, and user experience.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations
- **Redux Toolkit** - State management
- **Supabase Client** - Real-time subscriptions

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes** - Serverless API endpoints
- **Supabase** - Backend-as-a-Service
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **Row Level Security** - Database-level security
- **Web Crypto API** - Client-side encryption

### Infrastructure
- **Supabase** - Database, Auth, and Realtime
- **Vercel** - Deployment and hosting
- **GitHub** - Version control and CI/CD

## Architecture Principles

### Security-First Design
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all database tables
- End-to-end message encryption
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure session management
- Comprehensive error handling

### Performance Optimization
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Optimized database queries
- Efficient real-time subscriptions
- Minimal bundle size
- Lazy loading and code splitting

### Scalability
- Stateless API design
- Database connection pooling
- Efficient session management
- Automated cleanup procedures
- Horizontal scaling ready

## Database Architecture

### Core Tables
- `anonymous_users` - User profiles and activity
- `chat_sessions` - Chat session management
- `messages` - Encrypted message storage
- `message_reactions` - User reactions
- `reports` - User reporting system
- `banned_users` - Moderation system
- `user_roles` - Role-based access control
- `system_stats` - Analytics and monitoring

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Encrypted message storage
- Session-based access control
- Automated data cleanup
- Audit logging

## API Architecture

### RESTful Endpoints
- `/api/user/create-anonymous` - User creation
- `/api/user/update-activity` - Activity tracking
- `/api/chat/create-session` - Session management
- `/api/chat/send-message` - Message handling
- `/api/chat/session-status` - Session status
- `/api/chat/close-session` - Session cleanup
- `/api/admin/cleanup-sessions` - Admin operations

### Security Measures
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Error message sanitization
- Minimal data exposure
- Proper HTTP status codes

## Real-time Architecture

### WebSocket Connections
- Supabase Realtime for live updates
- Channel-based message delivery
- Server-side filtering and validation
- Connection health monitoring
- Automatic reconnection handling

### Message Flow
1. User sends message
2. Client-side encryption
3. API validation and storage
4. Real-time broadcast to session
5. Client-side decryption and display

## Security Architecture

### Multi-Layer Security
1. **Database Level** - RLS policies and constraints
2. **API Level** - Input validation and authorization
3. **Client Level** - Encryption and secure storage
4. **Network Level** - HTTPS and secure headers

### Encryption Strategy
- Session-based encryption keys
- Web Crypto API for client-side encryption
- Encrypted content in database
- Secure key derivation

## State Management

### Redux Store Structure
- `userSlice` - User state and authentication
- `chatSlice` - Chat sessions and messages
- `connectionSlice` - Real-time connection status

### State Flow
1. User actions trigger Redux actions
2. State updates trigger UI re-renders
3. Real-time updates sync with Redux state
4. Optimistic updates for better UX

## Performance Architecture

### Optimization Strategies
- Server-side rendering for initial load
- Client-side hydration for interactivity
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Real-time subscription optimization
- Bundle size optimization

### Monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- User activity analytics
- System health checks

## Deployment Architecture

### Production Setup
- Vercel for frontend deployment
- Supabase for backend services
- Environment-specific configurations
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Health checks and monitoring

### Development Workflow
- Local development with Supabase
- Feature branch development
- Automated testing and validation
- Code review and quality gates
- Continuous deployment

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Capacity
- Designed for thousands of concurrent users
- Efficient database queries and indexing
- Optimized real-time connections
- Automated cleanup and maintenance

### Future Scaling
- Horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Database read replicas
- CDN for static assets
- Microservices architecture potential

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Tracked
- User engagement and activity
- System performance and health
- Error rates and debugging
- Security events and anomalies

### Tools and Processes
- Built-in monitoring dashboards
- Automated alerting systems
- Regular security audits
- Performance optimization reviews
