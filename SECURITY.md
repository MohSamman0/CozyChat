# Security

CozyChat is built with security as a top priority. This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect user data and ensure a safe chat experience.

## Security Features

### 🔒 Row Level Security (RLS)
- All database tables have Row Level Security enabled
- Users can only access their own data and sessions
- Comprehensive RLS policies prevent data leakage
- Service role permissions are properly scoped

### 🛡️ Data Encryption
- End-to-end message encryption using Web Crypto API
- Session-based encryption keys derived from session IDs
- Encrypted content stored in database
- Plain text content never persisted

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- Anonymous user system with secure session management
- Session-based authentication with proper validation
- User activity tracking and session timeouts
- Automatic cleanup of stale sessions

### 🚫 Input Validation & Sanitization
- Comprehensive input validation on all API endpoints
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection through proper content sanitization
- Rate limiting on message sending and API calls

### 📊 Secure Logging
- Sensitive data automatically redacted from logs
- Environment-aware logging levels
- No sensitive information in production logs
- Structured logging for security monitoring

### 🌐 Network Security
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Secure headers configuration
- CORS properly configured
- Realtime connections with server-side filtering

### 🔄 Session Management
- Secure session ID generation
- Session expiration and cleanup
- Proper session invalidation on logout
- Protection against session hijacking

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Sensitive keys stored server-side only
- Environment-specific configuration
- No secrets in client-side code
- Proper key rotation procedures

### Database Security
- RLS policies on all tables
- Minimal necessary permissions
- Regular security audits
- Automated cleanup procedures

### API Security
- Input validation on all endpoints
